The mix of high fantasy, occult, Lovecraft-horror, and stories that took place in both the modern day and reached into European history all starred a very different kind of superhero called Hellboy This demon who might, you know, bring literal Hell to Earth wasn’t interested in the Nazis' plans – instead, he wanted to use his Right Hand of Doom to fight off the paranormal often with his pals in the BPRD at his side. The series helped to revive and mainstream horror comics as a genre, and has featured some of the most consistently high-level entertainment in the business for 24 years.</p></td>
